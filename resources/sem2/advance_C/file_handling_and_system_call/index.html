    <div class="content-box">
        <h1>File handling</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The input and output operations that we have performed so far were done through screen and keyboard
                only. After termination of program, all the entered data is lost because primary memory is volatile.
                When the data has to be used later, then it becomes necessary to keep it in permanent storage device. C
                supports the concept of files through which data can be stored on the disk or secondary strogage device.
                The stored data can be read whenever required. A file is a collection of related data placed on the
                disk.</li>
            <li>The file handling in C can be broadly categorized in two types:
                <ul>
                    <li>High level (standard files or stream oriented files)</li>
                    <li>Low level (system oriented files)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>High level file handling is managed by library functions while low level file handling is managed by
                system alls. The high level file handling is common used since it is easier to manage and hides most of
                the deatils from the programmer. In this chapter we'll discuss about high level file handling only.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Text and Binary modes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are two ways of storing data in files, binary format and text format.</li>
                <li>In text format, data is stored as lines of characters with each line terminated by a newline
                    character('\n').</li>
                <li>In binary format, data stored on the disk in the same way as it is represented in the computer
                    memory. Unix system do not make any distinction between text file and binary files.</li>
                <li>Text files are in human readable form and they can be created and read using any text editor, while
                    binary files are not in human readable form and they can be created and read only by specific
                    progran written for them. The binary data stored in the file can't be read using a text editor.</li>
                <li>The integer 1679 will take only 2 bytes in a binary file while it will occupy 4 bytes in a text file
                    because in-binary file it is stored as an integer. while in text file it is stored as a sequence of
                    4 characters i.e. '1', '6', '7', '9'.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Concept of buffer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Buffer is an area in memory where the data is temporarily stored before being writen to the file.
                    When we open a file, a buffer is automatically associated with its file pointer. Whatever data we
                    send to the file is not immediately written to the file. First it is sent to the buffer and when the
                    buffer is full then its contents are written to the file. When the file is closed, all the contents
                    of buffer are automatically written to the file even if the buffer is not full. This is called
                    flushing the buffer, we can also explicityly flush the buffer by a function fflush() described
                    later.</li>
                <li>The concept of buffer is used to increase efficiency. If there had been no buffer we would have to
                    access the disk each time for writing even single byte of data. This would have taken lot of time
                    beacuse each time the disk is accessed, the read/write head has to be repositioned. When buffering
                    is done, the data is collected in the buffer and data equal to the size of buffer is written to the
                    file at a time, so the number of times disk is accessed decreases, which improves efficiency.</li>
                <li>The steps for file operations in C programming are as follows-
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open a file</li>
                        <li>Read the file or write data in the file</li>
                        <li>Close the file</li>
                    </ol>
                    The functions fopen() and fclose() are used for opening and closing the files respectively.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Opening a file</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A file must be opened before any I/O operations can be performed on that file. The process of
                    estalishing a connection between the program and file is called opening the file.</li>
                <li>A structure named <b>FILE</b> is defined in the file stdio.h that contains all information about the
                    file like name, status, buffer size, current position, end of file status etc. All these details are
                    hidden from the programmer and the operating system takes care of all these things.</li>
                <li>A file pointer is a pointer to a structure of type FILE. Whenever a file is opened, a structure of
                    type FILE is associated with it, and a file pointer that points to this structure identifies this
                    file. The function fopen() is used to open a file.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Declaration:</h3>
                <pre>
                    <code>
FILE *fopen("filename.txt", "opening mode");
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>fopen() function takes two strings as arguments, the first one is the name of the file to be
                        open and the second one is the mode that decides which operations (read, write, append etc) are
                        to performed on the file. On success, fopen() returns a pointer of type FILE and on error it
                        returns NULL. </li>
                    <li>The return value of fopen() is assigned to a FILE pointer declared previously. For example
                        &darr;</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>

                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>After opening the file with fopen(), the name of file is not used in the program for any
                        operation on it. Whenever we have to perform a operation on the file, we'll use the file pointer
                        returned by fopen() function. so the name of file sometimes known as external name, while the
                        file pointer associated with it is knwon as its internal name. </li>

                <div class="in">
                    <p>The second argument represents the mode in which the file is to be opened. The possible value of
                        mode are &darr;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"w" (write): If the file doesn't exist then this mode creates a new file for writing, and if
                            the file already exists then the previous data is erased and the new data entered is written
                            to the file.</li>
                        <li>"a" (append): If the file doesn't exist then this mode creates a new file, and if the file
                            already exists then the new data entered is appended at the end of existing data. In this
                            mode, the data existing in the file is erased as in "w" mode.</li>
                        <li>"r" (read): This mode is used for opening an existing file for reading purpose only. The
                            file to be opened must exist and the previous data of file in not erased.</li>
                        <li>"w+" (write+read): This mode is same as "w" mode but in this mode we can also read and
                            modify the data. If the fiel doesn't exit then a new file is created and if the file exists
                            then previous data is erased.</li>
                        <li>"r+" (read+write): This mode is same as "r" mode but in this mode we can also write and
                            modify existing data. The file to be opened must exist and the previous data of file is not
                            erased. Since we can add new data modify existing data so this mode is also called update
                            mode.</li>
                        <li>"a+" (append+read): This mode is same as the "a" mode but in this mode we can also read the
                            data stored in the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created and if the file
                            already exists then new data is appended at the end of existing data. We cannot modify
                            existing data in this mode.</li>
                        <li>To open a file in binary mode we can append 'b' to the mode, and to open the file in text
                            mode 't' can be appended to the mode. But since text mode is the default mode, 't' is
                            generally omitted while opening file in text mode. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>"wb" &rarr; Binary file opened in write mode</li>
                                <li>"ab+" or "a+b" &rarr; Binary file opened in append mode</li>
                                <li>"rt+" or "r+t" &rarr; Text file opened in update mode</li>
                                <li>"w" &rarr; Text file open in write mode</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>If we try to open a file in read or update mode, and the file doesn't exit or we do not
                                have read permission on that file.</li>
                            <li>If we try to create a file but there is no space on the disk or we don't have write
                                permission.</li>
                            <li>If we try to create file that already exists and we don't have have permission to delete
                                that file.</li>
                            <li>Operating system limits the number of files that can be opened at a time and we are
                                trying to open more files than that number.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>We can give full pathname to open a file. Suppose we want to open a file in DOS whose path is
                        "E:\booksdir\names.dat, then we'll have to write as-
                        <br>fp = fopn("E:\\booksdir\\names.dat", "r");
                        <br>Here we have used double backslash because single backslash inside string is considered as
                        an escape character, '\b' and '\n' will be regarded as escape sequences if we use single
                        backslash. In Unix, a single forward slash can be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>Never give the mode in single quotes, since it is a string not a character constant.

            <ul>
                <li>On closing the file, all the buffers associated with it are flushed i.e. all the data that is in the

                <li>Although all the files are closed automatically when the program terminates normally, but sometimes
                    it may be necessary to close the file by fclose() e.g. when we have to reopen the file in some open
                    mode or when we exceed the number of opened files permitted by the system. Moreover it is a good
                    practise to close file explicitly by fclose() when no more operations are to be performed on that
                    file because it becomes clear to the reader of the program that the file has no use now.</li>

                    has been taken out of the drive.</li>
