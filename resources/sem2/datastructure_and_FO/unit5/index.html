        <p><b>Why Tree Data structure?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that
                store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time
                complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's
                computational world.</li>
            <li>Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data
                structure.</li>

                <p>The array method of representing a binary tree has some limitations and may not be suitable in all scenarios. Here are some reasons why the array method may not be considered ideal:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wasted space: The array representation can result in wasted space when the binary tree is not complete or nearly complete. If the tree is unbalanced, a significant portion of array will be left unused, leading to inefficient memory utilization.</li>
                        <li>Dynamic Size: The array representation requires a fixed-size array, which may be impractical if the size of the binary tree needs to change dynamically. If the tree grows beyond the capacity of the array, it would require resizing the array or allocating a larger array, resulting in extra overhead and potentially costly operations.</li>
                        <li>Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations can be challenging and inefficient in the array representation. When a new node is inserted or a node is deleted from the tree, it may require shifting elements in the array to maintain the tree structure, resulting in costly time complexity, especially for large trees.</li>
                        <li>Lack of Dynamic Operations: The array representation does not naturally support dynamic operations such as splitting or merging subtrees. Performing such operations efficiently would require additional manipulation of the array and potentially complex algorithms.</li>
                        <li>Tree Operations: Performing certain tree operations like finding the parent of a node or navigating to a particular level in the tree can be less straightforward and require additional calculations compared to other tree representations that use explicit pointers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>While the array representation has its advantages, such as simplicity and efficient indexing, it may not be the best choice in situations where the binary tree is large, dynamically changing, or unbalanced. Other representations like linked lists or explicit node structures with pointers may be more appropriate for such scenarios.</p>
