                computer's memory so that it can be used efficiently.</li>
            <li>Data may be organized in may different way, the logical or mathematical model of a particular
                organization of data is called a data structure.</li>

                    <li>Such structures are will supported by high-level languages and familiar examples are arrays
                        and records.</li>

                    <li>A data structure whose organizational characteristics may change during its lifetime.</li>
                    <li>The adaptability afforded by such structures, e.g. linked lists, is often at the expense of
                        decreased efficiency in accessing elements of the structure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <p>Linear data structure</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form any sequence.</li>
                    <li>There are basicallly two ways of representing such linear structure in memory.
                        <ol>
                            <li>One way is to have the linear relationships between the elements represented by
                                means of sequential memory location. These linear structures are called arrays.</li>
                            <li>The other way is to have the linear relationship between the elements represented by
                                means of pointers or links. These linear structures are called linked lists.
                                The common examples of linear data structure are arrays, queues, stacks and linked
                                lists.</li>

                    during the runtime.</li>
                <li>C provides some functions to achieve these tasks.</li>
                <li>There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <b>&lt;stdlib.h</b> header file to
                    facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>malloc()</li>
                        <li>calloc()</li>

                <p><b>Let's quickly brush up the concept of pointers:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pointer is a variable that stores address of another variable.</li>
                    <li>Note: The size of pointer is fixed in a particular system. The size of pointer doesn't depends
                        upon which datatype address it is storing.</li>
                    <li>why we have write data type before a pointer, for example- int *ptr?
                        <ul>
                            <li>The reason for this is that pointers in C and C++ are strongly typed, which means that
                                the data type of the variable being pointed to must match the data type of the pointer
                                itself. This is because pointers are used to store memory addresses, and the size of a
                                memory address can vary depending on the data type of the variable being pointed to.

                <h3>malloc() method</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "malloc" or "memory allocation" method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large
                        block of memory with the specified size.</li>
                    <li>It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form.</li>

                        ptr = (cast-type *) malloc(size of memory)
                       </code>

                        int *ptr;
                        ptr = (int *) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
                        
                        Since the size of int is 4 bytes, this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory.
                        And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.

                        we are using sizeof() because in different architecture its value changes

                            allocation fails, it returns NULL.</li>
                        <li>The function takes a single argument, which is the size of the memory block to be allocated
                            in bytes.</li>
                        <li>The memory allocated by 'malloc()' is not initialized, which means the contents of the block
                            will be undefined until initialized by the program.</li>
                        <li>The memory block allocated by 'malloc()' remains allocated until the program explicitly
                            frees it using the 'free()' function, or until the program terminates.</li>
                        <li>'malloc()' can be used to allocate memory for variables of any data type, including
