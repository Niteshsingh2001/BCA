            <h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>
            <p>Algorithm complexity refers to the amount of time and /or space requried by an algorithm to solve a problem. It is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is, and it is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input. <br>There are two types of algorithm complexity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Time complexity: This refers to the amount of time and algorithm takes to solve a problem, as a function of the size of the input. <ul>
                    <li>The time complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of operations or steps the algorithm takes.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Space complexity: This refers to the amount of memory an alogrithm requiers to solve a problem, as a function of the size of the input. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Space complexity is usually measured in terms of the amount of memory required for the input, the output, and any additional storage required by the algorithm</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both time and space complexity are important factors to consider when analyzing the performance of an algorithm. A good algorithm should have a low time and space complexity, meaning that it should be able to solve a problem quickly and with minimal use of memory. On the other hand, a poor algorithm may have a high time and space complexity, which can lead to slow performance or even failure to solve the problem for large input sizes.</p>

            <h2>Efficiency of Algorithm</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Time and space are two major measures of the efficiency of an algorithm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Example:
            <pre>
                    <code>

                                  A           B
                         time   10 sec      15 sec  
                        space   40 mb       13 mb

                        Algorithm A is more efficient tham B

                                 A           B
                        time   10 sec      10 sec  
                       space   15 mb        3 mb

                       Algorithm B is more efficient tham A
                    </code>

            <h2>Time-space trade-off</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>S &Proportional; 1 / T</li>
                <li>Time-space trade-off is a concept in computer science that involves making a choice between using more time to execute an algorithm or using more space to store data in order to optimize the overall performance of the algorithm.</li>
                <li>In many cases, it is possible to improve the time complexity of an algorithm by using more space, or to improve the space complexity of an algorithm by using more time. For example, consider a search algorithm that uses a hash table to store values. Using a larger hash table will reduce the likelihood of collisions and improve the time complexity of the algorithm, but it will also require more space to store the table. On the other hand, using a smaller hash table will reduce the space requirements of the algorithm, but may result in more collisions and a longer execution time.</li>
                <li>This trade-off between time and space complexity is often influenced by the specific requirements of the problem being solved and the available resources. For example, in a system with limited memory, it may be necessary to prioritize space efficiency over time efficiency to ensure that the algorithm can run at all. In contrast, in a system with abundant memory, it may be more practical to prioritize time efficiency over space efficiency to achieve faster performance.</li>
                <li>In general, the goal of time-space trade-off is to find the optimal balance between time and space complexity for a given problem, taking into account the available resources and the specific requirements of the problem being solved.</li>
