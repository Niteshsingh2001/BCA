        <h1>Memory Management</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory is the important part of the computer that is used to store te data. Its management is critical to the computer system because the amout of main memory available in a computer system is very limited.</li>
            <li>At any time, many processes are competing for it. Moreover, to increase performance, several processes are executed simultaneously. For this, we must keep several processes in the main memory, so it is even more important to manage them effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Role of memory management</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Allocation: Memory management is responsible for allocating memory to processes or programs when they request it. It tracks the availability of memory blocks and assigns them to processes based on their requirements. This allocation process ensures that each program receives the necessary memory to run correctly.</li>
                <li>Deallocation: When a process no longer needs memory, memory management deallocates the memory and makes it available for other processes. This deallocation prevents memory leakage and optimizes memory usage.</li>
                <li>Memory Organization: Memory management organizes the available memory space efficiently to accommodate multiple processes. It divides the memory into fixed-size blocks or pages, creating a logical structure that simplifies the allocation and deallocation process.</li>
                <li>Memory Protection: Memory management enforces memory protection mechanisms to ensure that processes do not access memory locations that they are not authorized to access. It prevents one process from interfering with another process's memory, which enhances security and stability.</li>
                <li>Memory Sharing: In certain cases, multiple processes may need to share memory resources. Memory management facilitates memory sharing by allowing multiple processes to access the same memory region, enabling efficient communication and data exchange between processes.</li>
                <li>Fragmentation Management: Memory management handles fragmentation, which can occur due to the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. It manages both internal fragmentation (unused memory within allocated blocks) and external fragmentation (unused memory between allocated blocks) to minimize wastage of memory.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Memory management Techiniques:</h2>
            <p>The memory management techniques can be classified into following main categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contiguous memory management schemes</li>
                    <li>Non-contiguous memory management schemes</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>What is a logical address?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A logical address is an address that is generated by the CPU during program execution. The logical address is a virtual address as it does not exist physically, and therefore, it is also known as a Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is a physical address?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The physical address identifies the physical location of required data in memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access it by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks it is running in it, but the program needs physical memory for its execution. Therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a logical address space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Difference between contiguous and Noncontiguous memory allocation:</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Contiguous memory allocation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method in which a single contiguous section/part of memory is allocated to a process or file needing it. Because of this all the available memory space resides at the same place together, which means that the freely/unused available memory partitions are not distributed in a random fashion here and there across the whole memory space.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Non-contiguous memory allocation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method on the contrary to contiguous allocation method, allocates the memory space present in different locations to the process as per it’s requirements. As all the available memory space is in a distributed pattern so the freely available memory space is also scattered here and there. This technique of memory allocation helps to reduce the wastage of memory, which eventually gives rise to Internal and external fragmentation.</li>

            <h2>Paging</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In operating systems, paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.</li>
                <li>The main idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages. The main memory will also be divided in the form of frames.</li>
                <li>One page of the process is to be stored in one of the frames of the memory. The pages can be stored at the different locations of the memory but the priority is always to find the contiguous frames or holes.</li>
                <li>
                    Pages of the process are brought into the main memory only when they are required otherwise they
                    reside in the secondary storage.
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>What is virtual memory in OS?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual Memory is a storage scheme that provides user an illusion of having a very big main memory. This is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory.
                </li>
                <li>In this scheme, User can load the bigger size processes than the available main memory by having the illusion that the memory is available to load the process.</li>
                <li>Instead of loading one big process in the main memory, the Operating System loads the different parts of more than one process in the main memory.</li>
                <li>By doing this, the degree of multiprogramming will be increased and therefore, the CPU utilization will also be increased.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How virtual memory works?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In modern word, virtual memory has become quite common these days. In this scheme, whenever some pages needs to be loaded in the main memory for the execution and the memory is not available for those many pages, then in that case, instead of stopping the pages from entering in the main memory, the OS search for the RAM area that are least used in the recent times or that
                    are not referenced and copy that into the secondary memory to make the space for the new pages in the main memory.</li>
                    <li>Since all this procedure happens automatically, therefore it makes the computer feel like it is having the unlimited RAM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Demand Paging</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demand Paging is a popular method of virtual memory management. In demand paging, the pages of a process which are least used, get stored in the secondary memory.</li>
                <li>A page is copied to the main memory when its demand is made or page fault occurs. There are various page replacement algorithms which are used to determine the pages which will be replaced. We will discuss each one of them later in detail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Advantages of virtual memory</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The degree of Multiprogramming will be increased.</li>
                <li>User can run large application with less real RAM.</li>
                <li>There is no need to buy more memory RAMs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Disadvantages of Virtual memory</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The system becomes slower since swapping takes time.</li>
                <li>It takes more time in switching between applications.</li>
                <li>The user will have the lesser hard disk space for its use.</li>

            <h2>File Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>File system is the part of the operating system which is responsible for file management. It provides a mechanism to store the data and access to the file contents including data and programs. Some operating systems treats everything as a file for example Ubuntu.</li>
                <li>The file system take care of the following issues
                    <ol>
                        <li>File structure: <br>We have seen various data structures in which the file can be stored. The task of the file system is to maintain an optimal file structure.</li>
                        <li>Recovering free space:
                            <br>Whenever a file gets deleted from the hard disk, there is a free spaced created in the disk. There can be may such spaces which need to be recovered in order to reallocate them to other files.
                        </li>
                        <li>Disk space assignment to the files: <br>The major concern about the file is decidding where to store the files on the hard disk.
                        </li>
                        <li>Tracking data location: 
                            <br>A File may or may not be stored within only one block. It can be stored in the non contiguous blocks on the disk. We need to keep track of all the blocks on which the part of the files reside.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            <h2>File System structure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>File system provide efficient access to the disk by allowing data to be stored, located and retrieved in a convenient way. A file system must be able to store the file, locate and retrieve the file.</li>
                <li>Most of the Operating Systems use layering approach for every task including file systems. Every
                    layer of the file system is responsible for some activities.</li>
