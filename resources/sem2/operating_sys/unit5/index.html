        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux is a popular open-source operating system.</li>
            <li>It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Torvalds was a computer science student
                at the University of Helsinki, Finland and began working on the Linux project as a personal endeavor.
                The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix, the operating system that inspired
                his projects.</li>
            <li>Linux is considered one of the most stable, secure and reliable operating systems and is widely used in
                servers, supercomputers and enterprise environments.</li>
            <li>Today, Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with an estimated 2.76% of
                all desktop computers and more than 90% of the world’s top supercomputers running on Linux, and approx.
                71.85% of all mobile devices run on Android, which is, you guessed it, Linux-based.</li>
            <li>The Linux community has expanded to include thousands of developers and users who work on the creation
                and upkeep of the operating system. Nowadays Linux has many distributions (versions) namely:
                <ol>
                    <li>Ubuntu</li>
                    <li>Fedora</li>
                    <li>Arch</li>
                    <li>Plasma</li>
                    <li>KDE</li>
                    <li>Mint</li>
                    <li>Manjaro</li>
                    <li>Nitrux (best for begginers)</li>
                    <li>Zorin OS (best for Windows user)</li>
                    <li>Pop!_OS (best for gaming)</li>
                    <li>Kodachi (best for privacy and security)</li>
                    <li>Rescatux (best for repair and rescue)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>How does Linux Work?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All Linux-based operating systems include a Linux kernel that manages hardware resources and a set
                    of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system. Organizations can also run linux
                    operating systems on Linux servers.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Kernel: </b>This is actually a component of the “Linux” system as a whole. The kernel,
                            which controls the CPU, memory, and peripherals, serves as the brain of the system. The
                            operating system’s kernel is at the most fundamental level.</li>
                        <li><b>Desktop Environment: </b>The user actually engages in interaction at this point. There
                            are numerous desktop environments available (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment,
                            KDE, Xfce, etc.). Every desktop environment has pre-installed programmes (file managers,
                            configuration tools, web browsers, games, etc.).</li>
                        <li><b>Shell: </b>Linux uses a command-line interface called a shell, which allows users to
                            interact with the operating system by typing commands. The shell interprets these commands
                            and communicates them to the kernel for execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Why Use Linux?</h2>
            <p>There are several reasons why one might choose to use linux:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Open-source: </b>Linux is open-source software, meaning that the source code is freely available
                    for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This allows for a large and active community of
                    developers to contribute to the development and maintenance of the operating system.</li>
                <li><b>Customizability:</b> Linux is highly customizable, means users can easily install and configure
                    different software packages to suit their needs.</li>
                <li><b>Stability and security:</b> Linux is known for its stability and security, as it is less prone to
                    crashes and viruses than other operating systems.</li>
                <li><b>Cost-effective:</b> Linux is free to download and use, making it a cost- effective option for
                    individuals and businesses.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Events leading to the creation of Linux</h2>
            <p>The emergence of Linux, one of the world’s most widely used open-source operating systems, can be traced
                to several important events and the work of a few people. Below is a summary of the major events that
                led to the emergence of Linux.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Unix development:</b> Linux was heavily influenced by the Unix operating system developed by Bell
                    Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unix was developed as a multi-user, multi-tasking operating
                    system and has been widely used in science and research.</li>
                <li><b>Minix is born:</b> In the early 1980s, computer science professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum created a
                    small Unix-like operating system called Minix. Minix was developed as an educational tool and the
                    source code was made available to students.</li>
                <li><b>Linux is born: </b> In 1991, a 21-year-old student named <b>Linus Torvalds</b> began working on a
                    new operating system, he named it Linux. Linus was inspired by his Minix and used its source code as
                    a starting point for his own projects. He also drew heavily on Unix design principles.</li>
                <li><b>Release of Linux 0.01:</b> In September 1991, Linus released the first version of his Linux
                    called Linux 0.01. It was a command-line operating system and was freely distributed on the
                    Internet.</li>
                <li><b>Linux community development:</b> In the years that followed, Linux quickly gained popularity
                    among programmers and enthusiasts. A community of developers began to form around Linux,
                    contributing to the development of the operating system by writing code, filing bug reports, and
                    providing feedback.</li>
                <li><b>Enterprise Adoption:</b> In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the open- source nature of Linux made
                    it more flexible, cost-effective, and more secure than proprietary operating systems such as
                    Windows, making
                    it a popular choice for enterprises and businesses. started being hired by companies. This increased
                    acceptance led to the development of commercial support and services for Linux.</li>
                <li><b>Linux Distribution Growth:</b> As Linux became more popular, various groups of developers began
                    creating their own versions of the operating system, called distributions (distro). Some of the most
                    popular distributions are Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu. These distros contain the Linux kernel and a
                    number of packages of easy-to-use tools and software that make using Linux easy for both developers
                    and end users.</li>
                <li><b>Linux in the Consumer Market:</b> Linux has also entered the consumer market with the advent of
                    Linux-based mobile devices, smart TVs, and other consumer electronics.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Development of Linux</h2>
            <p>The Linux ecosystem is a constantly evolving and expanding platform, so there is a lot of development
                going on. Notable recent developments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linux 5.11 kernel release. It includes new features such as AMD Zen 3 processor support, memory
                    management system improvements, and new hardware support.</li>
                <li>Continued development of various Linux distributions. Ubuntu 21.04 released in April 2021. It
                    features an updated Gnome desktop environment, improved ZFS file system support, and new security
                    features.</li>
                <li>Development of new open-source software and tools for Linux. For example, the release of version 6.0
                    of Ansible automation tools brings new features such as support for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
                    (WSL2) and improved support for Kubernetes.</li>
                <li>The rise of containerization and orchestration technologies such as
                    Docker and Kubernetes. They are becoming more and more common in
                    deploying and managing Linux-based applications.</li>
                <li>Linux is growing in popularity in the cloud computing space, with
                    many major cloud providers offering Linux-based virtual machines and managed services.</li>
                <li>ecurity Enhancements: Linux developers have been actively working on improving security measures.
                    Features like secure boot, kernel lockdown, and improved access controls have been introduced to
                    enhance the overall security posture of Linux-based systems. Efforts have also been made to address
                    vulnerabilities and mitigate potential threats through regular security updates.</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Linux has become a popular platform for AI and machine
                    learning applications. Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn are widely used for
                    developing and deploying machine learning models on Linux systems. There has been a focus on
                    optimizing these frameworks and providing better support for hardware acceleration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Linux Files</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In Linux system, everything is a file and if it is not a file, it is a process. A file doesn't
                    include only text files, images and compiled programs but also include partitions, hardware device
                    drivers and directories. Linux consider everything as as file.</li>
                <li><b>Types of Files:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Regular files: </b>It contain programs, executable files and text files.</li>
                        <li><b>Directory files (d)</b>: It is shown in blue color. It contain list of files.</li>
                        <li><b>Special files</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Block file (b)</li>
                                <li>Character device file (c)</li>
                                <li>Named pipe file (p)</li>
                                <li>Symbolic link file (l)</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Absolute and Relative Pathnames</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A path is a unique location of a file or a folder in a file system of an OS. A path to a file is
                        combination of / and alpha-numeric characters.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p><b>Absolute Pathname</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the
                            root directory (/).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To write an abosulte path-name:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start at the root directory (/) and work down.</li>
                        <li>Write a slash (/) after every directory name (last one is optional)</li>
                        <li>For example:
                            <pre>
                                    <code>  
$cat abc.sql
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                            Note: we don't have to write '$' its already written in terminal. <br>
                            'cat' command is used for displaying content of a file, in this case abc.sql.
                            <br>The above command only work when there is a file 'abc.sql' in the current directory.
                            <pre>
                                    <code>  
$cat /home/database/abc.sql
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                            In the above example, if the first character of a pathname is /, the file’s location must be
                            determined with respect to root.
                        </li>
                        <li>An <b>absolute path</b> is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from
                            the root directory(/). In other words,we can say that an absolute path is a complete path
                            from start of actual file system from / directory.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p><b>Relative path</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd). </li>
                        <li>It starts at your current directory and never starts with a /.</li>
                        <li>To be more specific let’s take a look on the below figure in which if we are looking for
                            photos then absolute path for it will be provided as /home/jono/photos but assuming that we
                            are already present in jono directory then the relative path for the same can be written as
                            simple <i>photos</i>.

                    <p><b>Using . and .. in Relative Path-names</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux offers a shortcut in the <b>relative pathname</b> that uses either the current or
                            parent directory as reference and specifies the path relative to it. </li>

                        <li>The single dot represents the present working directory, or where you are right now. Say
                            you're in your home directory and you want to copy the sshd_config file from /etc/ssh. You
                            can specify it with just a dot because you're copying the file to your current directory.
                            The command looks like this:
                            <pre>
                                <code>

                        </li>
                        <li>Double dots represent the parent directory, or the directory immediately above the current
                            one in the filesystem. If there's a subdirectory namedRockin theMusicdirectory, thenMusicis
                            the parent directory ofRock. As another example, consider where log files are stored:
                            /var/log. In that case, var is the parent directory of log (and the filesystem root / is the
                            parent of var).
                            <br>So, to move from the current <i>Rock</i> directory to the <i>Music</i> directory above
                            it, type:
