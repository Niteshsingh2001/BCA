            <h2>Introduction to Operating System and its Functions </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system is a system software which works as a interface between user and hardware.</li>
                <li>User cannot directly access hardware this is where Operating System helps user to access the
                    hardware.</li>
                <li>Why there is need of operating system?
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is no operating system and user want to access a particular hardware, he have to
                            write a program for it. Without OS interacting with hardware will become complex.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Major goal of OS is to provide convenience to the user.</li>
                <li>Throughput: number of tasks executed per unit time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux operating system provides throughput</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Major functionality of OS.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Resource manager: When there are multiple user in a system then OS manages the resource like
                    governing how much hardware to be provided to which user, so that system is not loaded.</li>
                <li>Process management: OS manages how to execute all the multiple process running at same time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here we use various CPU scheduling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Storage management (HD): Basically includes secondary devices. It manages how to store permanent
                    data in memory.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Storage management is done by "file mangement".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Memory management (RAM): managing how much memory of RAM to allocate or deallocate to different
                    process as RAM is limited.
                    <ul>
                        <li>it refers to management of primary memory.</li>
                        <li>main memory is a large array of bytes where each byte has its own address.</li>
                        <li>main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program
                            to executed, it must be in the main memory.</li>
                        <li>operating system keeps track of primary memory, ie what part of it are in use by whom, what
                            part are not in use.</li>
                        <li>in multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.</li>
                        <li>allocates and the memory when a process requests it to do so.</li>
                        <li>de-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Process management: in this OS decides which process gets time. This function is called <b>process
                        scheduling</b>. An operating system does the following activities for processor management:
                    <ul>
                        <li>keeps tracks of <b>processor and states of process</b>. The program responsible for this
                            task is known as <b>traffic controller.</b></li>
                        <li>allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.</li>
                        <li>de-allocates processor when a process in no longer required.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Device management: an operating system manages device communication via their respective <b>device
                        drivers</b>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>OS does the following things:</li>
                        <li>keep tracks of all devices. The program responsible for this task is known as the <b>I/O
                                controller. </b></li>
                        <li>allocates the device in the most efficient way.</li>
                        <li>de-allocates devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>File management: a file system is normally organized into <b>directories</b> for easy navigation and
                    usage. These directories may contain files and other directories.
                    <ul>
                        <li>O/S does &darr;</li>
                        <li>keeps track of information, location, user, status, etc. The collective facilities often
                            known as <b>file system.</b></li>
                        <li>decides who gets the resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Security and privacy: practising authentication
                    <ul>
                        <li>by means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to
                            programs and data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Control over system performance: records delary between request for a service and response from the
                    system.</li>
                <li>Job accounting: keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.</li>
                <li>Error detection aids: production of dumps, traces, error messages and other debugging and error
                    detecting aids.</li>
                <li>Co-ordination between other software and users: coordionation and assignment of compilers,
                    interpreters, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Goals of OS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Convenience: user can operate computer without knowing assembly.
                    <ul>
                        <li>easy to use.</li>
                        <li>user friendly</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Efficient: able to perform task easily.</li>
                <li>Ability to evolve: ability to improve.
                    <ul>
                        <li>permit development, testing, sercurity and updation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functions of operating system</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Process management: </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Properties or characteristics of OS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reliability: reliability is that a system does exactly what it is designed to do.
                    <ul>
                        <li>at software level OS must be more reliable on detecting virus or malicious code as they take control of the system for their own purposes by exploiting design or implementation errors in the operating system's defenses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Availability: it is the percentage of time that the system is usable. Some system crashes frequently, losing the user's work. Both reliability & availability are desirable.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Availability is affected by two factors: the frequencry of failure called the <b>mean time to failure (MTTF)</b> and the time it takes to restore a system to a working state after failure (for example, to reboot), the MTTR (mean time to repair).</li>
                        <li>Availability can be improved by increasing the MTTF or reducing the MTTR.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ease of management: OS must be easy to manage as there are lots of help & tutorials are available to rectify the erros.</li>
                <li>Security: as OS has administrative user that can make changes to the computer but for other user to make changes he has to enter the password of administration.</li>
                <li>Associated utilities: OS must have lots of associated utilities available like windows OS has lots of version and according to their version lots of free utilities are available like <b>MS Office + MS SQL + Developing Languages</b>.</li>
                <li>Cost: OS cost should be accordance of its features like windows has around $100 where DOS is free of charge as so is LINUX.</li>
                <li>Support for the users: OS should have a help section for users if any error or problem occurs, like Windows has a proper help section and websites, whereas Linux has books in pdf format available and DOS has websites and a forum for help as DOS is not very popular.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Dual mode of OS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The dual mode operation in the OS ensures the proper execution of the operating system and shields it from illegal users.</li>
                <li>Dual mode operation is OS means that there are two modes of the OS: One is user, and the other one is kernal mode.</li>
                <li>While working in dual mode operation in OS, to discover the mode in which the current instruction is getting executed, the mode bit is required. In case the value of the mode bit is 1, it operates in user mode, and if it is 0, it operates in kernal mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When the computer system runs the user applications such as file creation , they do not have direct access to the computer's hardware.</li>
                <li>In order to perform tasks hardware-related, such as when some interrupt occurs, the system must be switched to kernal mode. </li>
                <li>For the user, the mode bit is 1, which implies that the system will be in the User Mode in case the mode bit of the system's processor is 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Kernal mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Kernel Mode, all of the bottom-level tasks of the OS are performed.</li>
                <li>The kernel mode takes care of all the processes which need hardware support because the Kernel space has direct access to the system's hardware. Besides this, major Kernel Mode's functionality is the execution of priviledged instructions.</li>
                <li>These privileged instructions cannot be processed in the User mode as they are not provided user access. All the instructions and processes the user is restricted to obstruct are therefore executed in the Operating System's Kernel Mode.</li>
                <li>For the Kernel Mode, the mode bit is 0. Hence, the Mode bit of processor must be equal to 0 for the system to function in the Kernel Mode.</li>
                <li>Here are a few examples of privileged instructions: Input-Output management, Handling interrupts etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/kernal.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <h3>Switching between User Mode and Kernel Mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A process gets executed in user mode and kernel mode in its lifetime. In the user mode, the process has limited access. On the contrary, the kernel mode is the privileged mode in which the process has free access to system resources such as memory, hardware etc.</li>
                <li> Services such as hardware I/O can be executed by accessing kernel data in kernel mode. Anything linked with I/O hardware management, process management and memory management needs a process to get executed in Kernel mode. </li>
                <li>In Kernel mode, a process gets the power to access any device and memory, but any kind of crash in kernel mode brings down the entire system. However, if there is any crash in user mode, it brings down only the faulty process.</li>
                <li>The kernel offers SCI (System Call Interface), which acts as entry points for the user processes to enter into kernel mode. System calls are the only method by which a process can go from user mode to kernel mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why is switching required?</h3>
            <p>Two primary reasons for switching between user mode and kernel mode are</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If every process were to run in a single mode only, it would end up with Microsoft's concern in the earlier versions of Windows. If any process were competent enough to exploit a vulnerability, then that process could control the system.</li>
                <li>Some conditions are identified as a trap, a system fault or an exception usually caused by an exceptional condition like invalid memory access, division by zero etc. Such a trap situation can crash the whole operating system if the process is in kernel mode. A process running in user mode that comes across a trap situation crashes the user-mode process only.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Therefore, switching overhead is essential for a more stable and secure system.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Batch Operating System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here similar kind of job are combined to form a batch and given to hardware to execute it.</li>
                    <li>These systems were used in 1960s.</li>
                    <li>The user of this type of OS does not interact with the computer directly.</li>
                    <li>Each user prepares his job on an offline device like puch cards and submits it to the computer
                        operator.</li>
                    <li>There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them into
                        batch.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/batch.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <p>Advantages of BOS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would run when it is in queue.</li>
                    <li>Multiple users can share the batch systems.</li>
                    <li>It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Disadvantages</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The computer operators should be well known with batch systems.</li>
                    <li>Batch systems are hard to debug.</li>
                    <li>It is sometime costly.</li>
                    <li>The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.</li>

                <h3>Time-sharing or multitasking OS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The time-sharing operating system works by allocating time to a particular task and switching
                        between tasks frequently.</li>
                    <li>Time-sharing system allows users to complete their work in the system simultaneously.</li>

                <p>Advantages</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's a quick response during task performance.</li>
                    <li>It minimizes the idle time of the processor.</li>
                    <li>All tasks get an equal chane of being accomplished.</li>
                    <li>It reduces the chance of software duplication.</li>

                <h3>Multiprogramming OS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This OS can execute more than one program using a single processor machine.</li>
                    <li>More than one task or program or jobs are present inside the main memory at one point of time.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>CPU utilization is high because the CPU is never goes to idle state.</li>
                    <li>Memory utilization is efficient.</li>
                    <li>CPU throughput is high and also supports mulitple interactive user terminals.</li>

                <h3>Real-Time Operating System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a special-purpose operating system used in computers that has strict time constraints for
                        any job to be performed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Applications of RTOS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radar gadget.</li>
                    <li>Missile guidance.</li>
                    <li>Traffic manipulate gadget.</li>
                    <li>Autopilot travel simulators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Types of RTOS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hard Real-Time OS: All critical tasks must be completed within the specified time duration,
                        i.e., within the given deadline. Not meeting the deadline would result in critical failures such
                        as damage to equipment or even loss of human life.</li>
                    <li>Soft Real-Time OS: It accepts a few delays via the means of the Operating system. In this kind
                        of RTOS, there may be a closing date assigned for a particular job, but a delay for a small
                        amount of time is acceptable. So, cut off dates are treated softly via means of this kind of
                        RTOS.</li>
