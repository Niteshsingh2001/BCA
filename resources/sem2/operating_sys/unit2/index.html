            <h2>What is process?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A process is a <u>program in execution</u> including the current values of the program counter, registers and variables.</li>
                <li>The difference between a process and a program is that the program is the group of instruction where as the process is the activity. Or we can say process is an active state of program.</li>
                <li>We write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.</li>
                <li>When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections: stack, heap, text and data.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/process1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>Stack: The process stack contains the temporary data such as method/function, parameters, return address and local variables.</li>
                <li>Heap: This is dynamically allocated memory to a process during its runtim.</li>
                <li>Text: Program counters (It stores the list of address of next instructions that has to be executed after the current process) & content of processor registers.</li>
                <li>Data: This section contains the all global and static variables.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Process States</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When a process executes, it passes through different states.</li>
                <li>These stages may differ in different operating systems.</li>
                <li>In general, a process can have one of the following five states at a time.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/process2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Start:</b> This is the initial state when a process is first started/created.</li>
                <li><b>Ready:</b> The process are waiting to have the processor allocated to them by the operating system so that they can run.
                <ul>
                    <li>Process may comein to this state after <i>Start</i> state or while running it by but interrupted by the scheduler to assign CPU to some other process.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Running</b>: After <i>Ready</i> state, the process state is set to running and the processor execute its instruction.</li>
                <li><b>Waiting:</b> Process moves into the waiting state if it needs to wait for a resource, such as waiting for user input, or waiting for a file to become available.</li>
                <li><b>Terminated:</b> Once the process finishes its execution or its is terminated by the operating system, it is moved to the terminated state where it waits to be removed from main memory.</li>
