        <ul>
            <li>A program does nothing unless its instructions are executed by CPU.</li>
            <li>A program in execution is called a process.</li>
            <li>In order to accomplish its task, process needs the computer resources.</li>
            <li>There may exist more than one process in the system which may require the same resource at the same
                time. Therefore, the operating system has to manage all the processes and the resources in a convenient
                and efficient way.</li>
            <li>Some resources may need to be executed by one process at one time to maintain the consistency otherwise
                the system can become inconsistent, and deadlock may occur.
                <ul>
                    <li>A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because they are waiting for
                        each other to release resources.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with Process Management:
                <ol>
                    <li>Scheduling procees and threads on the CPU's.</li>
                    <li>Creating and deleting both user and system processes.</li>
                    <li>Suspending and resuming processes.</li>
                    <li>Providing mechanisms for process synchronization.</li>
                    <li>Providing mechanisms for process communication.</li>

            <h2>What is process?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A process is a <u>program in execution</u> including the current values of the program counter,
                    registers and variables.</li>
                <li>The difference between a process and a program is that the program is the group of instruction where
                    as the process is the activity. Or we can say process is an active state of program.</li>
                <li>We write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process
                    which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.</li>
                <li>When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four
                    sections: stack, heap, text and data.</li>
                <li>A process generally also includes the process stack, which contains temporary data (such as function
                    parameters, return addresses, and local variables), and a data section, which contains global
                    variables.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/process1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>Stack: The process stack contains the temporary data such as method/function, parameters, return
                    address and local variables.</li>
                <li>Heap: This is dynamically allocated memory to a process during its runtim.</li>
                <li>Text: Program counters (It stores the list of address of next instructions that has to be executed
                    after the current process) & content of processor registers.</li>
                <li>Data: This section contains the all global and static variables.</li>

            <h2>Process States</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When a process executes, it passes through different states.</li>
                <li>These stages may differ in different operating systems.</li>
                <li>In general, a process can have one of the following five states at a time.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/process2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li><b>New:</b> This is the initial state when a process is first started/created.</li>
                <li><b>Ready:</b> The process are waiting to have the processor allocated to them by the operating
                    system so that they can run.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Process may comein to this state after <i>Start</i> state or while running it by but
                            interrupted by the scheduler to assign CPU to some other process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Running</b>: After <i>Ready</i> state, the process state is set to running and the processor
                    execute its instruction.</li>
                <li><b>Waiting:</b> Process moves into the waiting state if it needs to wait for a resource, such as
                    waiting for user input, or waiting for a file to become available.</li>
                <li><b>Terminated:</b> Once the process finishes its execution or its is terminated by the operating
                    system, it is moved to the terminated state where it waits to be removed from main memory.</li>

                <h3>Attributes of a process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attributes of the process are used by the operating system to create the process control
                        block (PCB) for each of them.</li>
                    <li>This is also called context of the process. Attributes which are stored in the PCB are described
                        below.
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Process ID</b>: When a process is created, a unique id is assigned to the process
                                which is used for unique identification of the process in the system.</li>
                            <li><b>Program counter</b>: A program counter stores the address of the last instruction of
                                the process on which the process was suspended. The CPU uses this address when the
                                execution of this process is resumed.</li>
                            <li><b>Process State</b>: The process, from its creation to the complemention, goes through
                                various states which are new, ready, running and waiting.</li>
                            <li><b>Priority</b>: Every process has its own priority. The process with the highest
                                priority among the process gets the CPU first. This is also stored on the process
                                control block.</li>
                            <li><b>General Purpose Registers</b>: Every process has its own set of registers which are
                                used to hold the data which is generated during the execution of the process.</li>
                            <li><b>List of open files</b>: During the execution, every process uses some files which
                                need to be present in the main memory. OS also maintains a list of open files in the
                                PCB.</li>
                            <li><b>List of open devices</b>: OS also maintain the list of all open devices which are
                                used during the execution of the process.</li>

            <h2>Process Scheduling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system uses various schedulers for the process scheduling described below.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Long term scheduler</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Long term scheduler is also knwon as job scheduler. It chooses the process from the pool
                        (secondary memory) and keeps them in the ready queue maintained in the primary memory.</li>
                    <li>Long term schedular mainly controls the degree of multiprogramming. The purpose of long term
                        scheduler is to choose a perfect mix of IO bound and CPU bound processes among the process
                        present in the pool.</li>
                    <li>If the job scheduler chooses more IO bound processes, then all the process may reside in the
                        blocked state all the time and the CPU will remain idle most of the time. This will reduce the
                        degree of multiprogramming. Therefore, the job of long term scheduler is very critical and may
                        affect the system for a very long time.</li>

                    <li>The PCB related to the process is also stored in the queue of the same state.</li>
                    <li>If the process is moved from one state to another state then its PCB is also unlinked from the
                        corresponding queue and added to the other state queue in which the transition is made.</li>

                    <li>Convoy effect is a phenomenon which occurs in the scheduling algorithm named FCFS.</li>
                    <li>The FCFS Scheduling algorithm occurs in a way of non preemptive way.</li>
                    <li>The non preemptive way means that if a process or job is started execution, then the
                        operating system must complete is process or job. </li>
                    <li>Until, the process is zero the next process does not start its execution.</li>
                    <li>The definition of Non Preemptive scheduling in terms of OS means that the CPU will be
                        completely dedicated till the end of the process started first and the new process is
                        executed only after finishing of the older process.</li>
                    <li>There may be a few cases, which might cause the CPU to allot a too much time. This is
                        because in the FCFS sheduling alorithm non preemptive approach, the process are chose in
                        serial oder. Due, to this shorter process behind the larger process takes too much time to
                        complete its execution. Due, to this the WT, TAT, CT is very high.</li>
                    <li>If the first process if large or completion time is too high, then convoy effect in the FCFS
                        algorithm is occured.</li>
                    <li>Let us assume that longer job takes infinite time to complete. Then, the remaining processes
                        have to wait for the same infinite time. Due to this convoy effect created by the longer job
                        the starvation of the waiting processes increases very rapidly. this is the biggest
                        disadvantage of FCFS CPU process scheduling.</li>

                        go hand in hand with this. All other orders are left idle if the CPU is busy processing one

            <h2>Multiple-Processor Scheduling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPU's are available and hence <b>load sharing</b> becomes
                    possible.</li>
                <li>However multiple processor scheduling is more complex as compared to single processor scheduling.
                </li>
                <li>In multiple processor scheduling there are cases when the processors are identical i.e. HOMOGENEOUS,
                    in terms of their functionality, we can use any processor available to run any process in the queue.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Approaches to Multiple-Processor Scheduling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One approach is when all the scheduling decisions and I/O processing are handled by a single
                        processor which is called the <b>master server</b> and the other processors executes only the
                        <b>user code</b>. This is simple and reduces the need of data sharing. This entire scenario is
                        called <b>asymmetric multiprocessing.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>A second approach uses <b>symmetric multiprocessing</b> where each processor is self scheduling.
                        All processes may be in common ready queue or each processor may have its own private queue for
                        ready processes. The scheduling proceeds further by having the scheduler for each processor
                        examine the ready queue and select a process to execute.</li>

            <h2>Processor Affinity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Processor affinity is the ability to bind a process or thread to a specific CPU or core in a
                    multi-core system. This means that the process or thread will be scheduled to run exclusively on the
                    chosen CPU or core, and will not be allowed to run on any other CPU or core in the system.</li>
                <li>The purpose of processor affinity is to improve the performance of a system by reducing the overhead
                    of context switching between different CPUs or cores. By binding a process or thread to a specific
                    CPU or core, the operating system can reduce the time and resources needed to switch between
                    different CPUs or cores, which can result in faster execution times and more efficient use of system
                    resources.</li>
                <li>When a process runs on a specific processor there are certain effects on the cache memory. The
                    data most recently accessed by the process populate the cache for the processor and as a result
                    successive memory access by the process are often satisfied in the cache memory. Now if the
                    process migrates to another processor, the contents of the cache memory must be invalidated for
                    the first processor and the cache for the second processor must be repopulated. Because of the
                    high cost of invalidating and repopulating caches, most of the SMP(symmetric multiprocessing)
                    systems try to avoid migration of processes from one processor to another and try to keep a
                    process running on the same processor. This is known as PROCESSOR AFFINITY.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>There are two types of processor affinity:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Soft Affinity:</b> When an operating system has a policy of attempting to keep a process
                        running on the same processor but not guaranteering it will do so, this situation is called soft
                        affinity.</li>
                    <li><b>Hard Affinity:</b> Hard affinity allows a process to specify a subset of processors on which
                        it may run. Some systems such as Linux implements soft affinity but also provide some system
                        calls like <i>sched_setaffinity()</i> that supports hard affinity.</li>

            <h2>Load Balancing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Load balancing is a phenomena which keeps the workload evenly distributed accross all processors in
                    a SMP system. Load balancing is necessary only on systems where each processors has its own private
                    queue of process which are eligible to execute.</li>
                <li>Load balancing is unncessary because once a processor becomes idle it immediately extracts a
                    runnable process from the common run queue.</li>
                <li>On SMP, it is important to keep the workload balanced among all processors to fully utilize the
                    benefits of having more than one processor else one or more processor will sit idle while other
                    processors have high workloads along with lists of processors awaiting the CPU.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>There are two general approaches to load balancing:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Push Migration:</b> In push migration a task routinely checks the load on each
                        processor and if it finds an imbalance then it evenly distributes load on each
                        processors by moving the processes from overloaded to idle or less busy processors.</li>
                    <li><b>Pull Migration:</b> Pull Migration occurs when an idle processor pulls a waiting task
                        from a busy processor for its execution.</li>

            <h2>Multicore Processors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In multicore processors <b>multiple processor</b> core are placed on some physical chip.</li>
                <li>Each core has a register set to maintain its architectural state and thus appears to the operating
                    system as a separate physical processor.</li>
                <li><b>SMP systems</b> that use multicore processors are faster and consume less power than systems in
                    which each processor has its own physical chip.</li>
                <li>However multicore processors may complicate the scheduling problems.</li>
                <li>When processor accesses memory then it spends a significant amount of time waiting for the data to
                    become available, this situation is called <b>memory stall.</b> It occurs for various reasons such
                    as cache miss, which is accessing the data that is not in the cache memory. In such cases the
                    processor can spen upto fifty percent of its time waiting for data to become available from the
                    memory. To solve this problem recent hardware designs have implemented multithreaded processor cores
                    in which two or more hardware threads are assigned to each core. Therefor if one thread stalls while
                    waiting for the memory, core can switch to another thread.</li>

                        <li>Processes are basically the programs that are dispatched from the ready state and are
                            scheduled in the CPU for execution. PCB(Process Control Block) holds the concept of process.
                            A process can create other processes which are known as Child Processes. The process takes
                            more time to terminate and it is isolated means it does not share the memory with any other
                            process.</li>
                        <li>The process can have the following states: new, ready, running, waiting, terminated, and

            <h2>Multithreading in OS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Multithreading is a technique used in operating systems to enable multiple threads of execution
                    within a single process. A thread is a lightweight process that shares the same memory space and
                    resources as other threads in the same process. Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of
                    multiple tasks within a single process, making it possible to achieve better performance and
                    responsiveness in certain types of applications</li>
                <li>Lets say, for example a program is not capable of reading keystrokes while making drawings. These
                    tasks cannot be executed by the program at the same time. This problem can be solved through
                    multi-tasking so that two or more tasks can be executed simultaneously.</li>
                <li>One of the benefits of multithreading is that it can improve overall system responsiveness by
                    allowing applications to continue running even when some threads are blocked or waiting for I/O
                    operations to complete. Multithreading can also help to reduce the overhead associated with context
                    switching between processes, since switching between threads within a process is typically faster.
                </li>
                <li>The concept of multi-threading needs proper understanding of these two terms â€“ a process and
                    a thread.
                    <ul>
                        <li> A process is a program being executed. A process can be further divided into
                            independent units known as threads.</li>
                        <li>A thread is like a small light-weight process within a process.
                            Or we can say a collection of threads is what is known as a
                            process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Multi-tasking is of two types:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Processor based: It is totally managed by the OS.</li>
                        <li>Thread based: It can be controlled by the programmer to some extent.</li>

                <h3>Applicaitons</h3>
                <p>Threading is a technique used in computer programming to improve the performance and responsiveness
                    of software applications. It involves dividing a program into multiple smaller threads or tasks that
                    can be executed independently and concurrently</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Threading is used widely in almost every field.</li>
                    <li>Most widely it is seen over the internet nowadays where we are using transaction processing of
                        every type like reacharges, online transfer, banking etc.</li>
                    <li>GUI Applications: Threading is commonly used in Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications to
                        keep the interface responsive while performing computationally intensive tasks. For example,
                        when you click a button in a GUI application, a separate thread can be created to perform the
                        task while the main thread keeps the interface responsive.</li>
                    <li>Network Applications: Threading can be used in network applications to improve performance and
                        scalability. For example, a server application can use multiple threads to handle incoming
                        client connections simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Multimedia Applications: Threading is commonly used in multimedia applications to play audio and
                        video files while simultaneously performing other tasks. For example, a media player can use a
                        separate thread to play the media file while the main thread handles user input and interface
                        updates.</li>
                    <li>Parallel Processing: Threading can be used in parallel processing applications to speed up
                        computations by dividing a large task into smaller independent tasks that can be executed
                        simultaneously on different threads.</li>
                    <li>Games: Threading can be used in games to keep the game running smoothly while performing tasks
                        such as physics calculations, artificial intelligence, and rendering</li>
