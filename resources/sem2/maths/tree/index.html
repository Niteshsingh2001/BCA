        <h1>Tree</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A connected graph that contains no cycles (circuits) is called a tree. A tree is a simple graph i.e
                neither having self loop nor parallel edges.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../../images/treemath1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
        <ul>
            <li>Example:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Chain reaction</li>
                    <li>Flow of electricity</li>
                    <li>Administrative set up in an organization</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A tree 'T' with only one vertex is called a trivial or degeneral tree or empty tree otherwise 'T' is a non trivial tree.</li>
            <li>The number of vertex in a tree is called order of the tree.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>A tree with 'n' vertices has n-1 edges.</li>
                <li>There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices.</li>
                <li>It is minimally connected graph.</li>
                <li>Every non-trivial tree has two or more pendent vertices.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pendent vertex &rarr; A vertex is said to be pendent vertex or an end vertex if its degree in one.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Terminologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eccentricity &rarr; Eccentricity of a vertex 'v' of a graph 'G' (or Tree 'T') is denoted by E(v) which is the distance from 'v' to the vertex farthest from 'v' in 'G'.
                    <br>i.e., E(v) = Max d(v, vi), vi &isin; G
                </li>
                <li>Centre &rarr; A vertex of graph 'G' with minimum eccentricity is called the centre of 'G'.s</li>
                <li>Radius &rarr; The eccentricity of a centre in a tree is defined as the radious of the tree.</li>

            <h2>Binary tree</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A binary tree is rooted treein which every vertex has at most two children and each child of a vertex is designated as its left child or right child.</li>
                <li>The subtree rooted at the children of the root are the left subtree and the right subtree of the tree.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Full or complete binary tree</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A binary tree in which every vertex has either zero or two subtrees is said to be a full binary tree i.e., each vertex has either two or zero children.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Note &darr;</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a full binary tree there is exactly one vertex with degree 2 i.e. root and all other vertices have degree 1 or 3.</li>
                <li>A full binary tree will always have odd number of vertices say n.
                    <br>Proof:
                    <br>Since there is exactly one vertex (root) of even degree & the remaining (n-1) vertices are of odd degree, but the number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even therefore n-1 is even, hence n is odd.

            <h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each node has value greater than every node of left subtree and less than every node od right subtree.</li>
                <li>BST is very usefull data structure for searching of a node in minimum amount of time.</li>

                    <br> A graph can have more than one minimal spanning tree.

                    <li>List all the edges of the graph G in the non decreasing (ascending) order of weight.</li>
                    <li>Select edge with smallest weight, this is the first edge of spanning tree T. In case there exist more than one of smallest weight, arbitarily choose one of them.</li>
                    <li>Select from all the remaining edges of G having smallest value that does not form a circuit with the edges already included in T.</li>
                    <li>Continue step 3 until (n-1) edges have been selected, these edges will constitute the required shorted spanning tree.</li>
