            <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Speeches and Presentations are essential part of business communication.</li>
                <li>Every day business executives and employees have to make formal as well as informal speeches.</li>
                <li>Executives have to make speeches at company meetings, seminars, conferences, etc.</li>
                <li>Sales employees have to make hundreds of mini-presentations to persuage the potential customers to
                    buy.</li>
                <li>Speeches and presentations involve the same fundamental principles of oral communications and
                    provide the advantage of influencing people with enthusiasn and apparent confidence which written
                    document cannot.</li>
                <li>But compared with presentations, speeches are more formal and are delivered more on formal
                    occasions. Presentations are usually short and less formal. These are delivered with demonstrations
                    of audio-visual aids followed by answers to questions from the audience.</li>

                <h3>Speeches</h3>
                <p>Characteristics of a good speech</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clarity &rarr; The speaker should be clear in his ideas and he should have a good command over
                        language to express his ideas clearly so that they are instantly understood by the listeners.
                    </li>
                    <li>Length of speech &rarr; It should neither be too breif nor too long. If the speech is too long,
                        it will fail to sustain the interest of the audience for a long time. If it is too brief it
                        won't hold the attention of the listeners.</li>
                    <li>It should be informative &rarr; so that the audience can gain something from it. If the speaker
                        is repetitive and dwells at length on the points already known to the listeners, he will simply
                        bore the audience.</li>
                    <li>It should be interesting &rarr; If the speaker makes an appeal to the emotions of the listeners
                        he can easily win their hearts over to his side, and if the speeh appeals to the head also, it
                        will have the most desired effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>Should convery conrete facts rather than abstract ideas &rarr; a speaker should convery briefly
                        and clearly his ideas to the listeners.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How to make an effective speech?</h3>
                <p>Delivery of a good speech involves two steps. (1) The preparation for the speech. (2) The delivery of the Speech.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparation for the speech &rarr; preparation for the specch involves not only organisation of relevant thoughts but also careful selection of thoughts.

                            <li>The next step for the speakers is to decide upon the language in which he is to express his thoughts. He should prepare the whole speech before hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Delivery of the speech &rarr; The second step is the delivery of the speech. Once the preparation has been, made the opening of the speech is very important.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The speaker must appeal to the hearts as well as heads of the listerners and create interest in their minds.</li>
