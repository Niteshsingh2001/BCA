            <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Speeches and Presentations are essential part of business communication.</li>
                <li>Every day business executives and employees have to make formal as well as informal speeches.</li>
                <li>Executives have to make speeches at company meetings, seminars, conferences, etc.</li>
                <li>Sales employees have to make hundreds of mini-presentations to persuage the potential customers to
                    buy.</li>
                <li>Speeches and presentations involve the same fundamental principles of oral communications and
                    provide the advantage of influencing people with enthusiasn and apparent confidence which written
                    document cannot.</li>
                <li>But compared with presentations, speeches are more formal and are delivered more on formal
                    occasions. Presentations are usually short and less formal. These are delivered with demonstrations
                    of audio-visual aids followed by answers to questions from the audience.</li>

                <h3>Speeches</h3>
                <p>Characteristics of a good speech</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clarity &rarr; The speaker should be clear in his ideas and he should have a good command over
                        language to express his ideas clearly so that they are instantly understood by the listeners.
                    </li>
                    <li>Length of speech &rarr; It should neither be too breif nor too long. If the speech is too long,
                        it will fail to sustain the interest of the audience for a long time. If it is too brief it
                        won't hold the attention of the listeners.</li>
                    <li>It should be informative &rarr; so that the audience can gain something from it. If the speaker
                        is repetitive and dwells at length on the points already known to the listeners, he will simply
                        bore the audience.</li>
                    <li>It should be interesting &rarr; If the speaker makes an appeal to the emotions of the listeners
                        he can easily win their hearts over to his side, and if the speeh appeals to the head also, it
                        will have the most desired effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>Should convery conrete facts rather than abstract ideas &rarr; a speaker should convery briefly
                        and clearly his ideas to the listeners.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How to make an effective speech?</h3>
                <p>Delivery of a good speech involves two steps. (1) The preparation for the speech. (2) The delivery of
                    the Speech.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparation for the speech &rarr; preparation for the specch involves not only organisation of
                        relevant thoughts but also careful selection of thoughts.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The speaker must exclude irrelevant thoughts from the draft of the speech.</li>
                            <li>The next step for the speakers is to decide upon the language in which he is to express
                                his thoughts. He should prepare the whole speech before hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Delivery of the speech &rarr; The second step is the delivery of the speech. Once the
                        preparation has been, made the opening of the speech is very important.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The speaker must appeal to the hearts as well as heads of the listerners and create
                                interest in their minds.</li>
                            <li>He may open the topic with a striking quotation, he must emphasize how the topic affects
                                the vital interests of the audience.</li>
                            <li>He should vary the pitch of his voice according to the point to emphasized.</li>
                            <li>Eye contact with the audience should be made.</li>
                            <li>An important point to be discussed is the length of the speech. The speech should
                                neither be too long nor too short.</li>
                            <li>Closing of a speech is the most strategic part and should be carefully made. Towards the
                                close the speaker must summarize, restate and outline briefly the main points of the
                                speech. The closing may be wih a befiting verse, a biblical quotation or a relevant joke
                                but it must reflect the profundity and earnestness of the speaker.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>To Inform.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The basic purpose of presentation is to inform or teach the audience regarding new
                                schemes, new proposals, or new products, etc. Training presentations basically aim at
                                informing the new entrants about the organizational policies and procedures. Sales
                                presentations are made to inform the audience about the features of the product that
                                benefit the readers.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Presentations have another distinctive purpose of persuading the audience to act or to
                                believe in certain way. For example, sales presentations are made to persuade the buyers
                                to buy the product.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Still another purpose of presentations is to entertain the audience. Therefore, at the
                                end or during presentation, jokes are cut to entertain the audience.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Monologue Presentation</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In monologue presentations, the speaker speaks without interruption and at the end, answers
                            the questions of the audience. </li>
                        <li>The speaker plans the presentation in advance by collecting the relevant literature and

                        <li>This kind of presentation is most used in class room situations. But it leads the audience
                            to get bored. Therefore good delivery skill is needed to retain the attention of the
                            audience and to make it more interesting.</li>

                        <li> In the guided discussion, the speaker presents the questions or issues that both speaker
                            and audience have agreed in advance, and acts as facilitator to help the audience with the
                            expert knowledge. </li>
                        <li>This type of presentation is very useful when the audience has knowledge of the subject.
                            Here the speaker has to supplement with his specialized knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Compared with monologue presentations, guided discussions have following advantages:
                            <ul>
                                <li>More audience response</li>

                        <li>In this the speaker speaks to the audience, asks questions that raise their curiosity for
                            the product, overcomes their negative assumptions regarding product and finally gains their

                    <p>1- Audience Analysis</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the speaker has analysed the audience in proper way before presentation, his presentation will be more effective.</li>
                        <li>On the other hand, poor or improper audience analysis leads to ineffective presentation. </li>
                        <li> The style of the large, presentation should be more formal whereas informal presentation can work in presentation is largely dependent upon the type and size of the audience. If audience is

                        <li> Proper arrangement of these things can enhance the impact of the presentation. If there is noise in the surrounding environment, it detracts the audience from listening and consequently leaves unhealthy message.</li>
