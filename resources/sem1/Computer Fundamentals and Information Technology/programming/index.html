            <ul>
                <li>Programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow.</li>
                <li>Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand
                    and write.</li>
                <li>Programming language is made up of series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to
                    translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.</li>

                    <p><b>Low level languages</b></p>
                    <p>The languages in this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.</p>
                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Machine Level Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers can understand only digits signals, which are in binary digits i.e. 0 and 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>So the instructions given to the computer can be only in binary codes.</li>
                            <li>The machine language consists of instructions that are in binary 0 or 1.</li>
                            <li>Computers can understand only machine level language.</li>
                            <li>Writing a program in machine level language is a difficult task because it is not easy
                                for
                                programmers to write instructions in binary code.</li>
                            <li>A machine level language program is error-prone and its maintenance is very difficult.
                            </li>
                            <li>Furthermore machine language programs are not portable.</li>
                            <li>Every computer has its own machine instructions, so the programs written for one
                                computer
                                are not valid for other computers.</li>

                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Assembly Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a
                                modified form of machine level language called assembly language.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language instructions are given in English like words, such as MOV, ADD, SUB
                                etc. So it is easier-to write and understand assembly programs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Since a computer can
                                understand
                                only machine level language, assembly language program must be translated into mahcine
                                language.</li>
                            <li>The translator that is used for translating is called 'assembler'.</li>
                            <li>Although writing programs in assembly language is a bit easier, the programmer has to
                                know
                                all the lower level details related with the hardware of a computer.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language, data is stored in computer registers and each computer has
                                diiferent
                                set of registers. Thus the assembly language program is also not portable.</li>
                            <li>Since the low level languages are related with the hardware, the execution of a
                                low-level
                                program is faster.</li>

                        <li>High level languages are designed keeping in mind the features of portability i.e. these
                            languages are machine independent.</li>
                        <li>These are English like languages, so it is easy to write and understand the programs of
                            high-level language.</li>
                        <li>While programming in a high level language, the programmer is not concerned with the low
                            level details, and so the whole attention can be paid to the logic of the problem being
                            solved.</li>
                        <li>For translating a high-level language program into machine language, compiler or interpreter
                            is used.</li>
                        <li>Every language has its own compiler or interpreter.</li>

        <h2>The basic Object-oriented programming concepts are :</h2>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one (parent/super) class acquires the properties
                    (methods and fields) of another (child/sub). With the use of inheritance, the information is made
                    manageable in a hierarchical order.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to perform different actions (or, exhibit different
                    behaviors) based on the context.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality
                    will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object
                    does instead of how it does it.</li>
                <li>In Java, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism for wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data
                    (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from
                    other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is
                    also known as data hiding.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="wh">
        <h2>Fourth Generation Programming Language (4GL)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A fourth generation language is a grouping of programming languages that attempt to get closer than 3GLs
                to human language, form of thinking and conceptualization.</li>
            <li>4GLs are designed to reduce the overall time, effort and cost of software development.</li>
            <li>The main domains and families of 4GLs are :
                <ul>
                    <li>database queries</li>
                    <li>report generators</li>
                    <li>data manipulation</li>
                    <li>analysis and reporting</li>
                    <li>screen painters and generators</li>
                    <li>GUI creators</li>
                    <li>Mathematical optimization</li>
                    <li>web developmental and general puropse languages.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Advantages of 4GL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As databases are used everywhere to manage data so 4GL makes it very easy to create, manage and
                    operate the database.</li>
                <li>A single line command can perform the task. On the other hand, in other languages, we need to write
                    a series of commands for the same task, in which syntax and keywords are not easily understandable.
                </li>
                <li>This type of language just focuses on “what is required”.</li>
                <li>Users need not worry and define “how it needs to be performed”.</li>
                <li>It is very easy and simple to use even for beginners or end users.</li>
                <li>It reduces overall cost, time, and effort.</li>
