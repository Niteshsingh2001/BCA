                                system the OS works as Resource Manager, Its responsibility is to provide hardware to
                                the user.</li>
                            <li>It decreases the load in the system.</li>

                            <li>OS manages various tasks at a time.</li>
                            <li>Here <b>CPU Scheduling</b> happens means all the tasks would be done by the many

                            <li>The operating system has to keep track, how much memory has been used and by whom.</li>
                            <li>It has to decide which process needs memory space and how much.</li>
                            <li>OS also has to allocate and deallocate the memory space.</li>

                                unauthorized applications can't access programs or data.</li>
                            <li>For example, Windows uses <b>Kerberos</b> authentication to prevent unauthorized access

                                <li>The input to an assembler is an assembly language program. The output is an object
                                    program plus information that enables the loader to prepare the object program for
                                    execution.</li>

                                <li>A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and
                                    produces a corresponding object program.</li>
                                <li>An interpreter is a program that appears to execute a source program as if it was
                                    machine language.</li>
                                <li>The same name (FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.) is often used to designate both a compiler and

                                <li>There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating, and direct-linking.</li>
                                <li>In general, the loader must load, relocate and link the object program.</li>
                                <li>The loader is a program that places it in the core.</li>
                                <li>The loader places into memory the machine language version of the user's program and

                                <li>Since the loader program is much smaller than the assembler, those make more core

        <h1>MS-DOS Operating System</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A disk operating system (DOS) is an operating system for <a
                    href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/x/x86.htm" target="_blank">x86</a> based personal
                computers mostly developed by Microsoft.</li>
            <li>MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with
                MS-DOS.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is referred to as "DOS", which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system.</li>
            <li>MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s.
                <ul>
                    <li>It was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI) in
                        various graphical Microsoft Windows operating system generations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>DOS is also used to describe several similar command-line disk operating systems.</li>
            <li>Early computers, such as the Commodore 64, Atari 800, and Apple II, all featured a disk operating
                system, including Commodore Business Machines DOS, Atari DOS, and Apple DOS, respectively. DOS/360 was
                an OS for IBM mainframes, which first appeared in 1966, but it is unrelated to the 8086-based DOS of the
                1980s.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../../images/dos.svg" alt="" class="wb">
        <div class="in">
            <h3>How DOS works?</h3>
            <p>When a computer is powered on, it goes through various steps called <b>boot process</b>. For a computer
                running a disk operating system in the following six steps, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The read-only memory (ROM) bootstrap loader reads the Master Boot Record and passes control over to
                    it.
                <li>The boot record loads the disk operating system into memory, and it takes control of the machine.
                </li>
                <li>The computer transfers data stored on a magnetic disk to its main memory, the random access memory
                </li>
                <li>It also transfers data to external devices attached to the computer, such as a computer screen or
                    printer.</li>
                <li>The computer provides various applications that organizes, read, and writes files on storage. The
                    files are organized in a hierarchical structure of directories, subdirectories, and files.</li>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>A disk operating system doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI). Its interface is character-based,
                so users must type commands in the command line to indicate what actions they want.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in">
            <h3>Features of DOS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MS-DOS does not offer GUI (Graphical User Interface) and doesn't accept mouse inputs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a character-based interface system where all commands are entered in the text at the
                            command-line prompt.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A disk operating system manages files, folders and allows program loading and execution. It can
                    control hardware devices such as disk, memory and allocate resources.</li>
                <li>MS-DOS offers a file system to organize, read and write files to disk storage.</li>
                <li>It is a single-user operating system and performs various taks to ensure the proper operation of
                    systems.</li>
                <li>It uses a 16-bit file allocation table (FAT16), and a 16-bit interface is used to define the
                    location of the memory of each file uniquely. These identifiers are stored in a tabular format with
                    the name File Allocation table.</li>
                <li>MS-DOS does not support a multiuser operating system, and it is less secure and does not have

            <h3>Limitations of MS-DOS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built-in security &rarr; DOS does not have built-in security, such as file ownership and
                    permissions.</li>
                <li>No multiuser or multitasking &rarr; It also does not support multiuser or multitasking.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It can only run one program at a time, but it provides direct access to the basic I/O system
                            and underlying hardware.</li>
