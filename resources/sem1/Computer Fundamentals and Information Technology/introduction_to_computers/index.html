                                <li>It sends data and instructions to CPU.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>It can be calculations, comparisons, or decisions taken by the computer.</li>

            <h2>characteristics of computer :</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Speed &rarr;</b> The computer can process data very fast at the rate of millions of instructions
                    per
                    second.</li>
                <li><b>Accuracy &rarr;</b> Computers provide a high degree of accuracy. They respond to the user as per
                    the
                    input instrcutions.</li>
                <li><b>Storage Capacity &rarr;</b> Computers are capable to store huge amounts of data which depends on
                    the
                    capacity of the hard disk.</li>
                <li><b>Versatility &rarr;</b> Computers can do different types of work simultaneously. They can perform
                    maultiple tasks at the same time.</li>
                <li><b>Automation &rarr;</b> Once the instruction to do any work is given to the computer, the computer
                    does its work automatically by itself.</li>
                <li><b>Diligence (steady and careful application) &rarr;</b> Unlike human beings, a computer is free
                    from monotony(remaining same), tiredness, lack of concentration, etc., and can work for hours
                    without crating any errors.</li>
                <li><b>Secrecy &rarr;</b> Leakage of information is reduced by creating a login system with password
                    protection.</li>
                <li><b>Reliability &rarr;</b> Computers are more reliable than human beings.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer always produce exact results.</li>
                        <li>The possibility of errors occurs only if the input is wrong, i.e. the computers never make
                            mistakes of their own accord.</li>

                        <li>speed means the duration computer requires in fulfilling a task.</li>
                        <li>It is well-known that computers need very little time than humans in completing a task.</li>
                        <li>Nevertheless, computer systems have such fast operation capacity that the unit of time is in
                            fractions of a second. </li>
                        <li>Today, computers are capable of doing 100 million calculations per second and that is why
                            the industry has developed Million Instructions per Second (MIPS) as the criterion to
                            classify different computers according to speed.</li>

                        <li>Reliability is the quality due to which the user can stay dependable on the computer. </li>
                        <li>Computers systems are well-adjusted to do repetitive tasks. They never get tired, bored or
                            fatigued. Hence, they are a lot reliable than humans.</li>
                        <li>Still, there can be failures of a computer system due to internal and external reasons.</li>

                            tasks: simple as well as complex. </li>
                        <li>Computers are normally versatile unless designed for a specific operation.</li>
                        <li>Overall, a daily purpose computer is used in any area of application: business, industry,
                            scientific, statistical, technological and so on</li>
                        <li>A general purpose computer, when introduced in a company, can replace the jobs of multiple
                            specialists due to its flexibility.</li>
                        <li>A computer can replace the functions of all these specialists because of being very
                            versatile.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Storage is the ability of the computer to stroe data in itself for accessing it again in
                            future.</li>
                        <li>Nowadays, apart from having instantaneous access to data, computers have a huge ability to

        <h1>Components of Computers</h1>
        <p>There are 5 basic components of the computer which help in making this processing of data easier and
            convenient.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Input Unit</li>
            <li>Output Unit</li>
            <li>Memory Unit</li>
            <li>Control Unit</li>
            <li>Arithmetical and Logical Unit</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Input Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer will only respond when a command is given to the device.</li>
                <li>These commands can be given using the input unit or the input devices.</li>
                <li>For example &rarr; Using a keyboard we can type things on a Notepad and the computer processes the
                    entered data and then displays the output of the same of the screen</li>
                <li>The data entered can be in the form of numbers, alphabet, images, etc.</li>
                <li>We enter the information using an imput device, the processing usints convert it into computer
                    understandable languages and then the final output is received by a human-understandable language.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Output Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When we command a computer to perform a task, it reverts for the action performed and gives us a
                    result. This results is called output.</li>
                <li>There are various output devices connected to the computer.</li>
                <li>The most basic of which is amonitor.</li>
                <li>Whatever we write using keyboard or click using a mouse, is all displayed on the monitor.</li>
                <li>Thus, the output unit gives us the final result once the entire processing is done within the
                    mechanism of a device.</li>
                <li>For example: when we visit an ATM, we enter our details like language, pin, amount to be withdrawn,
                    etc. and then the final money which the cash dispenser releases is our outcome. In this case, the
                    cash dispenser acts as an output unit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Memory Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When we enter the data into the computer using an input device, the entered information immediately
                    gets saved in the memory unit of the CPU.</li>
                <li>Because of the presence of some existing programming, the MU transmits the data further to the other
                    parts of the CPU></li>
                <li>Similarly, when the output of our command is processed by the computer, it is saved in the memory
                    unit before giving the output to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Control Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the core unit which manages the entire functioning of the computer device.</li>
                <li>It is one of the most essential components of the computer system.</li>
                <li>The Control Unit collects the data entered using the input unit, leads it on for processing and once
                    that is done, receives the output and presents it to the user.</li>
                <li>It can be said to the centre of all processing actions taking place inside a computer device.</li>
                <li>Basically, the instructions taken, interpretation of entered data, issuing signals to execute the
                    data and then finally retrieving the data is all done in the control unit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Arithmetic & Logical Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As the name suggests, all the mathematical calculations or arithmetic operations are performed in
                    the Arithmetic and Logical Unit of the CPU.</li>
                <li>It can perform actions like a comparision of data and decision-making actions.</li>
                <li>ALU comprises circuits using which addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and other
                    numerical based calculations can be performed.</li>

            <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>

                <li>The CPU is the core of any computer devices. It comprises three major components of the computer
                    which have been discussed above :
