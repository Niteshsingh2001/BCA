            <h3>Fayol's Principles of Mangement</h3>
            <p>Henry Fayol, a famous industrialist of France, has described fourteen principles of management in his
                book "General and Industrialist Management".
                <br>The fourteen principles given by Fayol are as under:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Division of work</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The whole work is divided into smaller task and each individual should do one task of
                            the work according to his ability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Authority and Responsibility</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Authority means power to take decisions and responsibility means to complete the job
                            assigned on time under the guidance of upper management.</li>
                        <li>There should be a
                            balance between authority and responsibility. Mere responsibility without authority
                            makes
                            an executive less interested in discharging duties. Similarly, giving authority without
                            assigning responsibility makes him arrogant and there is fear of misuse of power.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Discipline</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the obedience to organizational rules by the subordinates. Discipline requires good
                            supervisors at all levels, clear and fair agreements and judicious application of
                            penalties.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Unity of command</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An individual employee should receive orders from only one superior at a time, otherwise
                            it will create confusion, conflict, disturbance and overlapping activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Unity of Direction</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each group of activities having the same objective must have one head and one plan. This
                            ensures unity of action and coordination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Remuneration of Employees</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The overall pay and compensation should be, fair to both
                            employees and the organization. The employees should be given fair wages so that they
                            can have
                            a reasonable standard of living. Wages should be within the paying capacity of the
                            organisation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Subordination of Individual Interest to general interest</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interest of an organization should take priority over the interest of any individual
                            employee. In simple words the organisation interest to be prioritiezed over individual
                            interest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Centralization and Decentralization</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Centralization means concentration of decisions making authority in few hands at top
                            level, whereas distribution of power at every level of management is decentralization.
                            Both should be balanced as no organization can be completely centralized or completely
                            decentralized.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Scalar Chain</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The formal lines of authority between superiors and subordinates from the highest to the
                            lowest ranks is known as scalar chain. This chain should not be violated but in
                            emergency employees at same level can contact through Gang Plank by informing their
                            immediate superiors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Order</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People and material should be in suitable places at appropriate time for maximum
                            efficieny.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Equity</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The working environment of any organization should be free from all forms of
                            discrimination (religion, language, caste, sex, belief) and principles of justice and
                            fair play should be followed. No worker should be unduly favoured or punished.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Stability of personnel</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A personnel shoud be selected and appointed after strict procedure and the selected
                            person should be kept at the post for a minimum tenure to show results.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Initiative</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Workers should be encouraged to develop and carry out their plan for improvements.
                            Initiative means taking the first step with self-motivation. It is thinking out and
                            executing the plan.</li>
                    </ul>
