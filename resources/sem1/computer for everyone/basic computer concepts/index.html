                <li><b>Definition &rarr; </b>A computer is a programmable machine designed to perform arithmetic and
                    logical operation automatically and sequentially on the input given by the user and gives the
                    desired output after processing.</li>

                <h3>Characteristics of computer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Accuracy &rArr;</b> Computer always give accurate result depend upon data provided.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed &rArr;</b> It can perform millions of instructions/operation per second, which takes a
                        lot of time if done manually.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Speed of computer is given in nano secconds
                                <br> 1 nano second = 1 x 10<sup>-9</sup>sec
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Reliability &rArr; </b> Computer are more reliable then human beings
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer always produce exact results.</li>
                        <li>The possibility of errors occurs only in the input is wrong i.e. the computers never make mistakes on their own.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Versatility &rarr; </b> Computers can do different types of work simultaneously. They can perform multiple tasks at the same time.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage &rArr;</b> As humans can forget things after period of time but computer can store data for long time.</li>

                <h3>Disadvantages of computer:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lack of common-sense</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is one of the major limitations of computer</li>
                        <li>Now matter how efficient, fast and reliable computers might be but yet do not have any common sense because no full-proof algorithm has been designed to programme logic into them.</li>
                        <li>As computers function based on the stored programmes, they simply lack common sense.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Zero IQ</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer have zero Intelligence Quotient (IQ).</li>
                        <li>They are unable to see and think the actions to perform in a particular situation unless that situation is already programmed in to them.</li>
                        <li>Computers are programmable to complete each and every task, however small it may be.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Lack of decision-making</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decision-making is a complicated process involving information, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom, and ability to judje.</li>
                        <li>The computer does not have the ability to make decisions on their own because they do not possess all the essentials of decision-making.</li>
