                <h3>Classifying Networks by Component Roles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Another method used to classify networks focuses on the roles the networked computers play in the network's operation, and more specifically on which computer controls that operation.</li>
                    <li>There are two basic types of role classifications for networks -- peer-to-peer networks and sever-based networks.</li>
                    <li>The difference between the two revolves around which computer is in charge of the network.</li>
                    <li>A third classification, client-based networks, has come into existence because of the increased capabilities of the typical client computer.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Peer-to-Peer Networks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A peer is considered an equal. All computers on a peer-to-peer network can be considered equals.</li>
                        <li>That is to say no one computer is in charge of the network's operation.</li>
                        <li>Each computer controls its own information and is capable its own information and is capable of functioning as either a client or a server depending on which is needed at the time.</li>
                        <li>Peer-to-peer networks are popular as home networks and for use in small companies because they are inexpensive and easy to install.</li>
                        <li>Most operating system come with peer-to-peer networking capability built in.</li>
                        <li>Typical intitial peer-to-peer networking involves no security measures.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rather, each peer simply shares its resources and allows other open access to them.</li>
                                <li>In fact, a peer-to-peer network becomes difficult to manage when more and more security is added to the resources.</li>
                                <li>This is because users control their own security by adding password protection to each share they create.</li>
                                <li><b>Shares</b> are any resources users control on their computers, such as document folders, printers, and other peripherals.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>While peer-to-peer networks are inexpensive to set up, they are extremely limited in scope.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The accepted maximum number of peers that can opperate on a peer-to-peer network is ten.</li>
                                <li>They are, therefore, not appropriate for larger, more secure networks.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h3>Server-Based Networks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlike peer-to-peer networks that operate without central control and are difficult to secure, a server-based network offers centralized control and is designed for secured operations.</li>
                        <li>While there are still both clients and servers on a server-based network, a dedicated server controls the network.
                            <ul>
                                <li>A dedicated server is one that, for all practical purposes, operates solely as a server.</li>
                                <li>A dedicated server on a server-based network services its network clients by storing data applications, other resources, and then providing access to those resources when called for by a client.</li>
                                <li>When a client requests a resource such as a document, the server sends the whole resource (the document) over the network to the client, where it is processed and later returned to the server for continued storage.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Dedicated server can also control the entire network's security from one central location or share that control with other specially configured servers.</li>

                    <h3>Client-Based Networks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-based networks are a further refinement to the concept of a server-based network that relieves the heavy burden on the network's capacity resulting from freqently server-performed transactions.</li>
                        <li>A client-based network takes better advantage of the server's powerful processors and of the increasingly powerful computers used in typical workstations.</li>
                        <li>A client based network utilizes a client workstation's power in processing some functions locally while requesting additional processing from a server whenever it is needed for increased speed.</li>
