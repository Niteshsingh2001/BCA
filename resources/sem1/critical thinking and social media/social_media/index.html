            <h2>What is social media?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Social media is as a set of software and web tools that help users interact online, share content
                    and develop a personalised network of friends, colleagues or organisations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>History of Social Networking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Social networking was born one day in 1971, when the first email was sent.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The two computers were sitting right next to each other. </li>
                        <li>The message said "qwertyuiop".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In 1978, the BBS–or Bulletin Board System, was created.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The BBS hosted on personal computers, where users need to dial in via the modem of a host
                            computer, and exchanging data through phone lines to other users.</li>
                        <li>The BBS was the first system that lets users interact with one another through the internet.
                        </li>
                        <li>It was slow, but it was a good start, and only one user could log in at a time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Later that year, the very first web browsers were distributed using Usenet, the earliest online
                    bulletin board of the time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usenet was created by Jim Ellis & Tom Truscott, where users posted news, articles and funny
                            posts.</li>
                        <li> Unlike the BBS and forums, Usenet did not have a ‘central server’. </li>
                        <li>This concept soon inspired the 'Groups' feature we know today; such as Yahoo! Groups, Google
                            Groups and Facebook Groups.</li>
                        <li>The first ever version of instant messaging was around 1988, called IRC or Internet Relay
                            Chat.</li>
                        <li>IRC was Unix-based then, and thus exclusive only to few people.</li>
                        <li>IRC was used for communications, as well as link and file sharing. </li>
                        <li>Soon the earliest copies of web browsers were distributed via Usenet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h3>The first social networking site</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1994, the first social networking site was created, Geocities.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It allowed the users to create and customize their own web sites, grouping them into
                                different 'cities' based on the site's content.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The following year, TheGlobe.com launched to public, giving users the ability to interact with
                        people who have the same hobbies and interests, and to publish their own content.</li>
                    <li>In 1997 AOL Instant Messenger and SixDegrees.com was lauched.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instant messaging was born, giving users the freedom to chat with friends, and create a
                                profile.</li>
                            <li>AOL was probably the true precursor to today's social networking sites.</li>
                            <li>The member profiles allowed its users to write a biography and share details about
                                themselves.</li>
                            <li>The profiles were searchable so people could look your profile up.</li>
                            <li>It was the most innovative feature at that time.</li>
                        </ul>
