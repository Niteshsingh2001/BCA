            <h2>Information Overload</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Refers to the scenario when there's way too much information about one particular item on the
                    internet.</li>
                <li>Information overload can also be defined as a situation when people are confronted with a massive
                    amount of information created on social media which exceeds the capacity they can handle.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It can cause individual uncertainty in making decisions, and difficulty to recall prior
                            knowledge.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Most of this information is irrelevant and may even pose some negative effects to social media
                    users.</li>
                <li>The average daily information dumped on a social network user is 54,000 workds, equivalent to the
                    length of the average novel. That textual content is only 63 percent of the information dumped on
                    every social network user on a daily basis.</li>
                <li>Information overload is real, and it a probliem to health and productivity when abused. Anyone can
                    simply look up for information on the amount of information published online daily, but we highly
                    unlikely come across a reasearch on the amount of daily information dumped on every user.</li>

            <h2>Dubious(not honest/safe) Claims</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>"Social media is responsible for the rise of fake news"</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Misinformation has always been around, and its recent proliferation is in a large part the result of an upsurge of information in general.</li>
                        <li>The label "fake news" is an unhelpful catch-all for a diverse array of phenomena.</li>
                        <li>And while the most viral fake news is, well, viral, it has not been proven that lies are more infectious than truth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>"Social media has done damage to mental health"</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>So though there is some speculation that social media may act as a force multiplier for existing mental health conditions, there just hasn't been enough research to say for sure.</li>
                    <li>And like the claim that Twitter has caused a crisis of fake news, it has not been proven that social media is a major independent cause for the cirsis in adolescent mental health.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>"Social media has stolen our attention span"</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>As with the other two claims, then, there simply is not robust evidence demonstrating a causal link between attention spans and social media.</li>
                    <li>And even if there were, reducing out time spent on individual tasks might be a necessary adaptation to navigating our new infomration-laden world.</li>
                    <li>Ultimately, perhaps we should be giving more unwavering attention to the lack of evidence for bold claims about social media.</li>
