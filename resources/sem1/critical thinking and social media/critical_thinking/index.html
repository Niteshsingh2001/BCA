                        <li>Conceptualizing is the understanding and ability to form an idea.</li>

                        <li>When you infer, you examine prior experience and knowledge and combine them with suggested facts to arrive at a new belief or course of action.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Synthesize information :
