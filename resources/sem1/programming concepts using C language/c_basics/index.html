            <h2>Introduction to C Language</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the
                    Unix operating system.</li>
                <li>It was first implemented on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972.</li>
                <li>The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix appications are written in the C language.</li>
                <li>C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to learn</li>
                        <li>Structured language</li>
                        <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
                        <li>It can handle low-level activities.</li>
                        <li>It can be complied on a variety of computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <p><b>Facts about C</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li>
                    <li>C is a successor of B languange which was introducted around 1970.</li>
                    <li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</li>
                    <li>By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in C.</li>
                    <li>Today C is the most widely used System Programming Language.</li>
                    <li>Most of the state of the art software have been implemented using C</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <p><b>Why to use C?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the
                        operating system.</li>
                    <li>C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast
                        as code written in assembly language.</li>
                    <li>Some example of the use of C might be :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Operating System</li>
                            <li>Language Compilers</li>
                            <li>Assemblers</li>
                            <li>Text Editors</li>
                            <li>Print Spoolers</li>
                            <li>Network Drivers</li>
                            <li>Modern Programs</li>
                            <li>Data Bases</li>
                            <li>Language Interpreters</li>

                <p><b>Characteristics of 'C'</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has a very small size.</li>
                    <li>The major use of function calls in it.</li>
                    <li>Couply loose typing.</li>
                    <li>It is a structured language.</li>
                    <li>It has the ability to read low level (Bitwise) programming.</li>
                    <li>The large use of pointers for memory, array, structures and functions.</li>
                    <li>High-level constructs.</li>
                    <li>The program written in C is efficient.</li>
                    <li>C can be compiled on a variety of computers.</li>
                    <li>The C programming language is used to write a variety of applications so that we can say that it
                        is a general-purpose programming language. It is a "System programming language".</li>
                    <li>C supports modular programming means a big program can divide into different modules or
                        functions.</li>
                    <li>It is also a standalone programming language. Due to these characteristics of C it is most
                        popular.</li>
                    <li>C has very fast compilation and execution in comparision to other programming languages.</li>
                    <li>C is easy and free available, You just have to download its software, intall it on your system,
                        and start coding.</li>
                    <li>It has many in-built memory management functions malloc(), calloc(), and alloc() to utilize the
                        memory efficiently.</li>
